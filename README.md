# Experts on Twitter Machine Learning Project
This project was completed in a group of four for a data processing and machine learning subject. We were given the twitter dataset and had to generate a question that could be answered using a supervised learning model. The question posed was 'Can an expert on Twitter be identified from only the stylistic features of their tweets?'. The original creators of the dataset (dataset and article can be found [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303874897_Expertise_in_Social_Networks_How_Do_Experts_Differ_From_Other_Users)) focused more on individual features, so we extended this to create a holistic model using classification models. The process our group took is outlined in the Jupyter notebook and begins with the original pre-processing all the way to the supervised learning models. The file is quite large so may run quite slowly.
